# perceptrons
This is my perceptron with all-pairs voting implementation used for training and testing on the UCI machine learning [letter recognition] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition) dataset.

##**Usage:**
To run the project, use `python perceptrons.py` with the "combined training" and "testing" folders in the same path.
